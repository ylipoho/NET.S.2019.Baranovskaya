## Description: 

1. Create a class that allows to get GCD using Euclidean algorythm for 2, 3 and more integer numbers. Class methods also
must determine the time required to complete the calculation.
Add to the class methods that implement the Stein algorithm
(binary Euclidean algorithm) for calculating the GCD of 2, 3 and more integers. Methods must also determine the value
the time required to complete the calculations. Create Unit-tests for
testing methods.
2. Implement the extension method to get a string binary
representation of a double precision real number in IEEE 754 format. Create Unit-tests.
