## Description: 

Develop an immutable Polynomial class (polynomial) for work
with polynomials of degree from one variable of real type
(as an internal structure for storing coefficients
use sz-array). For developed class:
● override the virtual methods of the Object class;
● overload operations allowed for working with polynomials (excluding
division of a polynomial by a polynomial), including “==” and “!=”.
Create Unit tests.
2. Implement the jagged array bubble sorting algorithm
an integer array (the sorting methods of the System.Array class are not
use) in such a way that it is possible to order the rows of the matrix:
● in ascending (descending) amounts of matrix row elements;
● in ascending (descending) order of maximum elements of matrix rows;
● in ascending order (descending) of the minimum elements of the rows of the matrix;
Create Unit tests.
