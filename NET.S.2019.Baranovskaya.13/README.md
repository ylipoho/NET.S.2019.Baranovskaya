## Description 

### Task 1. Queue

Develop a generic Queue class-collection that implements the main operations to work with the queue, and allowing iteration by implementing an iterator "manually" (without using a block
iterator _yield_). Create Unit-tests.

### Task 2. Matrices

Create generic classes to represent square, symmetric and diagonal matrices. Describe in created classes an event that occurs when a matrix element with indexes changes (i, j). Extend the functionality of the existing class hierarchy by adding the possibility of adding two matrices of any type. Create Unit-tests.

### Task 3. Binary search tree

Develop a generic class-collection BinarySearchTree. Provide for the use of plug
interface to implement the relationship order. Implement direct, transverse and reverse tree traversal. To implement use a iterator yield. 
To test developed class using the following types:
* System.Int32 (use default comparison and plugin
comparator);
* System.String (use default comparison and plugin
comparator);
* Custom class Book, order relationships implemented for objects of this class (use default comparison and plug-in comparator);
* Custom Point structure, order relationships are notimplemented order relationship (use plug comparator).
